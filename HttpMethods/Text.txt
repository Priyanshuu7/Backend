HTTP Methods Overview:::
Introduction to HTTP Methods::
-->HTTP methods are used to perform actions on resources on a server. 
-->The primary methods include GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE .

1.GET Method::
-->Definition: The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server. 
-->It is the default method used by web browsers when a URL is entered.
Example: When a user enters a URL like youtube.com/search, the browser sends a GET request to fetch data from the server .
Expectation: When a GET request is made, the expectation is to receive data in response.


2.POST Method::
-->Definition: The POST method is used to send data to the server, often resulting in a change in the server's state or side effects on the server.
-->Use Case: Commonly used in forms where users submit data, such as signing up or logging in.
Example: When a user fills out a sign-up form and submits it, a POST request is created to send the data to the server .


3.PUT Method::
-->Definition: The PUT method is used to update existing resources or create a new resource if it does not exist .
-->Use Case: Typically used for file uploads or updating user information, such as changing a profile picture .


4. PATCH Method::
-->Definition: The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource .
-->Use Case: Useful when only specific fields of a resource need to be updated, rather than replacing the entire resource .


5. DELETE Method::

-->Definition: The DELETE method is used to remove a resource from the server .
-->Use Case: Commonly used for actions like deleting user accounts or removing items from a shopping cart .


Conclusion::
-->Common Usage: The most commonly used methods are GET and POST, with GET for retrieving data and POST for sending data to the server .
-->Handling Requests: In practical applications, handling these methods can be managed using frameworks like Express, which simplifies the process of routing and managing requests
